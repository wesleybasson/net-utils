## Introduction

The Fluent Flow Library allows developers to define, execute, and manage custom workflows with ease. It provides a set of tools and structures to help design intricate processes without the intricacies of building everything from scratch.

## Features

- Fluent API for defining workflows.
- Built-in logging mechanisms.
- Modular step-based design.
- Open for extensions.
- Exception handling and flow controls.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core 3.1 or later

## Installation

```sh
# Using NuGet package manager
nuget install FluentFlowLibrary
```

## Usage

### Defining Flows

Use the `FlowBase` class to define a new flow. Here's a quick example using the `CreateTicketFlow`:

```csharp
public class CreateTicketFlow : FlowBase<CreateTicketFlow.DataContext>
{
    protected override void DefineSteps(FlowStepsRegistry stepsRegistry) => stepsRegistry
        .AddStep<CheckMasterApiKeyMatchStep>()
        .AddStep<CheckUserAndCompanyStep>()
        ...
}
```

### Handling Steps

Every step in the flow is a separate component that defines its logic and data context. 

Example:

```csharp
public class CheckMasterApiKeyMatchStep : FlowStepBase<CheckMasterApiKeyMatchStep.DataContext>
{
    ...
    protected override Task OnExecute(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```
